# Multi-Objective Optimization and Genetic Programming of Technical Indicators for Trading

This research studies the integration of Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) and Genetic Programming (GP) in trading strategies using Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Slow Stochastic (SS) indicators. The MOO agent in our method is the niched-Pareto Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). Our research attempts to minimize risk-adjusted returns and maximize cumulative returns by applying a multi-objective approach. Comparing the use of MOO and GP to conventional single-objective techniques, empirical data show a considerable improvement in strategy performance. Our results highlight how financial trading techniques can be improved by combining MOO and GP, possibly yielding larger returns at levels of controlled risk.
